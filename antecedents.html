        What can we do before a behaviour takes place to make it more likely to occur? These are less familiar than consequences but equally important. The goal is to encourage repeat practice; doing something regularly creates habits.

        <ol>
            <li>Playfull challenges: I bet you can't put your shoes on in under 2 mins, you'd have to be a super hero to do that.</li>
            <li>Offer assistance: until a behaviour becomes a habit, helping them will encourage them</li>
            <li>Say please: some parents don't think they should have to, but (i) kids mirror parents and (ii)it's makes this next one easier.</li>
            <li>Gentle tone of voice: shouting "oi, be quiet now" will never work long term.</li>
            <li>Be clear and specific: "pick up five items of clothing and put them in the wash basket" is much better than "go tidy your room".</li>
            <li>Offer choices: "do you want your red coat or your blue jumper?" rather than "put this on".</li>
        </ol>
