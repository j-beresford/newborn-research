        <h2>Newborn</h2> 
        <p>2 to 4 hours is the longest he'll sleep</p>

        <h2>2-3 month</h2>
        <p>can sleep for five- or six-hour stretches. That said, most 3-month-olds still need a feeding or two during the night, especially if they're nursing.</p>

        <h2>4 months</h2>
        <p>Can sleep for a solid seven or eight hours, though it may happen gradually. That's because most 4-month-old babies have reached that magic weight of 5 to 7kg, which means they don't metabolically need a nighttime feeding. But they may still demand one!</p>
        
        <h2>5-6 months</h2>
        <p>By now, babies are able to sleep through the night, so if still waking up more frequently to eat, you can be pretty sure he's not really hungry. Start to cut out those extra nighttime feedings.</p>
