            <summary>Tips for first few weeks</summary>
            <ul>
                <li>Take naps when your baby sleeps</li>
                <li>Turn off all phones in the house when your baby is sleeping</li>
                <li>Go out without your baby for breaks, e.g walk, coffee</li>
                <li>Plan a few hours of private time to take care of yourself</li>
                <li>In the first few weeks, soothe your baby however easiest, don't worry about bad habits or spoiling him</li>
            </ul>
        </details>

        <h2>First month</h2> 
        <p>Main goal in month one is to develop self-soothing skills. Keep intervals of wakefulness brief to avoid getting overtired. By 6 weeks, most babies will be more settled at night, sleep a bit longer, and begin to show drowsy signs earlier in the evening.</p>
        
        <h3>Week 1</h3>
        <p>No established rhythms. Begin to teach self-soothing, and feed only when your baby is hungry at night. Can't use clock time. Full-term babies should sleep a lot (15-18 hours a day, in short stretches of 2-4 hours). Sleep when your baby sleeps. Turn off your phone when nursing and napping.</p> 
        
        <p>Soothing is harder in the evening and at night, but should settle more at 6 weeks.</p>
        
        <p>First nap is always going down drowsy but awake, done by Justin. If it doesn't work, pick him up immediately. Try again later on. Except this to only work 10% of the time, doubling each week.</p>  
        

        
        <h3>Weeks 2-4</h3> 
        <p>No established rhythms. Don't sleep for long periods at night - longest sleep period could be 3-4 hours and occur at day or night. Changing light or noise doesn't seem to have much of an impact at this stage. *Try not to respond to every whimper.* After a few weeks, if breastfeeding, consider a once-a-day relief bottle.</p>
        
        <h2>Second month (12th May onwards)</h2>
        
        <h3>Weeks 5-6</h3> 
        <p>Nightsleep: More evening fussiness maybe associated with less night sleep. After 6 weeks (24th May), night sleep rhythms emerge. Daysleep: naps still brief and irregular, may be many cat naps. Bedtimes: irregular and may occur late, between 9 and 11pm. Main thing is all the self soothing, many hands, drowsy but awake. <b>Start establishing bed time routines.</b> </p>
        
        <h3>6-week peak (24th May</h3>
        <p>All babys are most fussy, cry most, most wakeful. Main goal is to prevent second wind. Move bedtime earlier after 6 weeks.</p>
        
        <h3>Weeks 7-8 (31st May to 7th June)</h3> 
        <p>Night sleep becoming organised. Daysleep: naps brief and irregular, may be many cat naps. Bedtime: starting to become earlier. Single longest period of sleep is 4-6 hours and will occur in the evening, often before midnight. Feed your child only when necessary and try to avoid unnecessary feedings (i.e. don't feed whimpers). During night, try to delay response to non-distress vocalisations, or send dad in (maybe with bottle).</p>
        
        <h2> Third month (12th June onwards)</h2>
        
        <h3>Weeks 8-12 (12th June to 12th July)</h3>
        <p>Continuation of weeks 7-8. Becoming less portable and can't just sleep anywhere. Become sensitive to difference between brief interrupted sleep and long uninterrupted naps. By now, not using swings, cars or strollers to get him to sleep. <b>Mid morning nap develops between 9 and 10am.</b></p>
        
        <h2>Fourth month (12th July onwards)</h2>
        
        <h3>Extinction starts, following Emily Oster:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bedtime/start of night: go to bed at 6.30. Routine, PJs, book, bath, guitar. Feed, then down to bed. Not return at all before 10.30 (four hour gap, our bed time, maybe dream feed??)</li>
            <li>Feed Louis first time he cries after 4 hours. After first feeding, don't respond again until 2 hours after end of last feeding.</li>
            <li>The morning: wake up between half 6 and half 7. Wake him up at half 7 if he's not already up. Before half 6, if he's been fed, ignore.</li>
            <li>From 10 weeks, he is eating 2 or 3 times a night.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fifth month (12th Aug onwards)</h3>
        <p>Goes to own room and two feeds a night. May wake to feed 4-6 hours after last feeding, but shouldn't be fed more than twice a night. If feed at middnight, don't feed at 2am. So proably a feeding at 11 and 4am ish. For these two feeds, respond promptly (so you both remain sleepy) but no talking, lights, cuddling etc.</p>
        
        <p>Consider dream feed before bed, to avoid a second night feed.</p>
