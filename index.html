    This website is primarily designed to help your baby  become a better sleeper. It is based on Dr Weissbluth's 'Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child' and sets out the steps to take right from birth. The aim is for your baby to develop the essential self-soothing skills that will allow both parents and babies to get a good night's sleep.  
    </p>
    <p>The parenting section outlines behaviour change tehniques for older children. It is based on a coursera course, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/everyday-parenting/home/week/2">Everyday parenting</a>, by Alan E. Kazdin of Yale.</p>

    <p>
    I've also got a <a href="https://names.shinyapps.io/names/">names website</a> on the off chance you're sturggling to think of one. Statistically speaking, the best boys name is Louis, and the best girls name is Anna. They're both taken, sorry.
