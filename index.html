    <p>Here's my research on baby sleeping. Sleep training is <a href="https://emilyoster.substack.com/p/sleep-training-is-it-bad?s=r">the right thing to do</a>. If you don't agree, probably don't read this. But know that you're siding with those who <a href="https://www.junomagazine.com/balancing-evidence-with-intuition/">literally and openly don't believe in evidence</a></p>
