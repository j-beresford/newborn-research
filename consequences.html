        A section on 'time out' and 'points charts' is coming, but ideally we never have to use these. Instead we just ignore bad behaviours - maybe by leaving the room - and praise good behaviours. All praise is good and to be encouraged, but it's not all created equal either, there are three components of 'special praise':
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Verbal praise: fantastic!</li>
            <li>State the exact behaviour: you put on your shoes as soon as I asked!</li>
            <li>Physical contact: pat, hug, kiss etc.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>A few things to avoid:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>NegComs: "That was great, why cant you always be that good?!"</li>
            <li>Conditional affection: "Mummy and Daddy really love you when you tidy your room" - no, we ALWAYS love you. </li>
            <li>Vagueness and delays:
             "you were so good last weekend". Not harmful, but not really helpful either.</li>
        </ol>
