        <h1>Behaviours</h1>

        <h2>Shaping</h2>
        <p>Rewarding small steps that approximate or begin to resemble the behaviour you wish. For example, 10 mins of homework, then 20 mins etc up to an hour. We're used to doing this for some stuff: we get so excited we get when baby says maaa, "wow he said Mummy!"</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Specify behaviour: gently instruct rather than tell or order</li>
            <li>Select seed of that bevahiour: start small, just clear your plate, and remember to use antecedents</li>
            <li>Select reinforcer: praise, points etc</li>
            <li>Reinforce occurances: using special praise techniques</li>
            <li>Increase requirements: build up slowly, two or three dishes</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Being compliant at dinner table carries over to other places. Praise them for being a good listener for the easy stuff that has no tension. 
        </p> 


        <p>Reasons for failure: don't set the bar too high, that's the most common reason. Avoid slippery slope thinking: it's fine to help, you won't always have to.</p>

        <h2>Simulation</h2>
        <p>All of techniques are designed to create practice, which builds habits and changes the brain. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Imagine a child with terrible tantrums: we want 'calm' tantrums, no hitting/throwing/shouting. </li>
            <li>Lets play the tantrum game: I'm going to pretend you can't watch TV. After that, pretend to have a tantrum, but no hitting/throwing/shouting</li>
            <li>Mum and Dad can have the first go at playing the game. </li>
            <li>Praise: that was amazing, you got mad but stayed calm. Hug and specify what he did.</li>
            <li>I bet you can't do it: it's too hard and i'm not sure you're big enough to do it again.</li>    
        </ol>
        <p>        1. select bahabiour, 2. explain game nicely, 3. play game. 4 praise, 5. playful challenge to do it again
        </p>

        <h2>Modelling</h2>
        <p>Teaching by example. You're modelling all the time: from how you brush your teeth, to how you treat others. If you use sarcasm on kid, kid will be sarcastic at school. Same for hitting etc...</p>
        <p>How to harness modelling:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select a behaviour: be kind to others</li>
            <li>List specifc examples of kindness: helping others, sharing, comforting, letting other people go first...</li>
            <li>Do the kind thing, then say "I just gave this person money for lunch because they don't have any". Say the act so it's clear, but don't say how kind you are.</li>
            <li>Praise instances of kindness</li>
        </ol>
